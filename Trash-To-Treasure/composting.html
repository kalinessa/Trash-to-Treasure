  <h2>What is Composting?</h2>
  <p>Through composting, organic materials like food scraps decompose into compost, a nutrient-rich material that can be
    applied to gardening and agriculture. Composting is a natural process of recycling food waste to improve soil.</p>

  <h2>Why Compost?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Over 63 million tons of food waste was produced in 2018, <strong>only 4.1%</strong> of which was composted.
      <strong>Over half of all food waste</strong> was sent to landfills (<a
        href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data">EPA</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Food waste in landfills generates large amounts of methane, a strong greenhouse gas (<a
        href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting">EPA</a>).
      Composting greatly reduces methane emissions.</li>
    <li>Composting reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides while improving soil health, which is useful for
      restoring wetlands, forests, and habitats.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Compost</h2>
  <p>To make compost, you need water, air, carbon-rich materials like dry leaves and plant stalks (also called
    “browns”), and nitrogen-rich materials like food scraps (also called “greens”) (<a
      href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home">EPA</a>). View the items that are compostable or not
    compostable below:</p>

  <h2>How to Compost</h2>

  <h3>Backyard Composting</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Store food scraps (“greens”) in a closed container, and set aside a space outside for leaves and twigs
      (“browns”).</li>
    <li>Get a bin to store your compost pile; it should be located close to a water source.</li>
    <li>Prepare composting ingredients by breaking food scraps into smaller pieces.</li>
    <li>Start the composting pile with a layer of browns, and then layer on greens and browns in an alternating order.
      There should be two to three times more browns than greens.</li>
    <li>Maintain the pile by occasionally turning and mixing the materials.</li>
    <li>Let the compost cure for four weeks when there are no visible food scraps and the pile no longer heats up after
      mixing.</li>
  </ol>
