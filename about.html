      <h2>What is Trash to Treasure (T<sup>3</sup>)?</h2>
      <p>Trash to Treasure, or T<sup>3</sup>, was founded by four students who hope to raise awareness about recycling
        and reducing waste. T<sup>3</sup> uses artificial intelligence, trained on hundreds of images, to quickly help
        you determine whether an object is recyclable or not.</p>

      <h2>Why Did We Create T<sup>3</sup>?</h2>
      <p>The US produced <strong>over 292 million tons</strong> of trash in 2018, only 32% of which was recycled or
        composted (<a
          href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials">EPA</a>).
        According to a 2019 report by The Tishman Environment and Design Center at The New School, 79% of trash
        incinerators fall within communities that are low income and predominantly people of color (<a
          href="https://www.tishmancenter.org/blog/4-4-million-people-in-the-u-s-are-exposed-to-pollution-from-waste-incinerators">Baptista
          & Perovich, 2019</a>). These sites expose communities to pollution, posing health concerns. More than any
        other state, Florida has 10 trash incinerators. Waste is an environmental justice issue that is closely tied to
        climate change and discrimination.</p>
      <p>Recycling is often considered a solution to waste. However, recycling is complicated: Guidelines about what to
        recycle vary by location. <strong>Contamination</strong> occurs when people mistakenly put non-recyclable items
        into recycling bins, which interferes with the recycling process and damages equipment. According to <a
          href="https://recyclops.com/understanding-recycling-contamination/">Recyclops</a>, around 19-40% of collected
        recyclables are contaminated. Additionally, many recyclable items fail to be properly recycled. In 2018, only 9%
        of plastics, 25% of glass, and 68% of paper was recycled or composted (<a
          href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#R&Ctrends">EPA</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Contamination is a prominent reason why Davie, the town where the T<sup>3</sup> team attend school, has stopped
        recycling in recent years. Instead, all recyclables are sent to an incinerator, thrown away like trash. Other
        cities around the US are doing the same. Our team built the Trash to Treasure AI project to raise awareness
        about this issue and educate people about what can and cannot be recycled.</p>
